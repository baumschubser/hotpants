## Installation
Head over to [releases](/releases) and download the .jad or .jar file. Copy it to your phone (Bluetooth, USBâ€¦) and you should be ready to go.

## Usage
Just add HOTP and TOTP providers. Since Hotpants can not scan QR codes (yet?), you have to type in the secret manually. Once this is done, you can simply read the temporary TOTP timepad password or the current HOTP password!
To generate the next HOTP password, just select the entry an click "New Pin".

## Todo
Maybe add QR scan?
