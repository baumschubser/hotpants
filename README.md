# Hotpants
## A HOTP one time password generator for feature phones

A J2ME Java application to manage your two-factor authentication with your dumphone on the go.

## Installation
Head over to [releases](/releases) and download the .jad or .jar file. Copy it to your phone (Bluetooth, USBâ€¦) and you should be ready to go.

## Usage
Just add HOTP providers. Since Hotpants can not scan QR codes (yet?), you have to type in the secret manually. Once this is done, you have HOTP codes forever!

## Todo
Maybe add QR scan?
TOTP would be another OTP to support. Since I do not need it at the moment, I won't put much work in it.
